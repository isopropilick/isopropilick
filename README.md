### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Eric A.K.A. @isopropilick, I am a software developer from Mexico, I currently work as SDET at VASION.

My main languages are Python and JavaScript but I am not afraid to touch any language in general I enjoy working more on hardware projects (electronics and IoT) than on software ones.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... some GOlang and practicing my skills in CNC and 3D printing techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any OpenSource project! Get in touch!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter (@isopropilick)
