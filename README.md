### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Eric A.K.A. @isopropilick, I am a software developer from Mexico, I currently work as SDET at VASION.

My main languages are Python and JavaScript but I am not afraid to touch any language in general I enjoy working more on hardware projects (electronics and IoT) than on software ones.

I am currently learning some GOlang and practicing my skills in CNC and 3D printing techniques.
